                Singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Jenna Raine has
                won over supporters across the globe with her sweetly expressive
                vocals and magnetic stage presence. Her single “see you later
                (ten years)” has transformed from a gorgeously stripped-back,
                introspective song that she wrote alone at her piano into a
                massively beloved anthem of healing and hope. Born on February
                17, 2004, Raine is 20 years old at the time of writing.

              Born during her personal quest to write 100 songs during lockdown,
              “see you later (ten years)” immediately went viral on TikTok where
              Jenna now has more than 1.4 million followers. The poignant piano
              ballad took on a life of its own, with hundreds of thousand`````````````````````````````````````s of
              videos created that share stories of struggles, heartbreak and
              resilience using the powerful lyric “this isn’t goodbye, this is
              simply a see you later.” Upon its official release, the song
              quickly rose to #1 on Spotify’s Global and US Viral Charts,
              racking up more than 33 million streams and earning radio support,
              debuting on Billboard’s Adult Top 40 Chart.

              Raine is from Westlake, Texas, a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth.
              Raine rose to fame soon after her song, “see you later (ten
              years),” went viral on TikTok in 2021. The singer signed a deal
              with Warner Records and SB Projects. Raine’s romantic track “2%”
              is about young love and the small percentage of high school
              sweethearts who end up staying together and getting married.
              Looking to the future, Raine says she plans to continue releasing
              music that feels true to her.

            text-size-adjust: 20pt;">
              Raine’s inspiration was her friend who fell in love with a
              gold-digger boy. Raine felt miserable and wanted her friend to
              realize the value of letting go. With lyrics such as “Forgot your
              card, guess I’ll pay / Apologies you’ve never made / I’m so tired
              of feeling this way / All you took, all I gave,” the track
              demonstrates frustration and angst. In “see you later,” Raine
              sings, “’Cause time wasn’t in our favor / This isn’t goodbye, this
              is simply see you later.” She says she wrote the song about love
              with the right person at the wrong time and that the track helped
              her heal. She’s been pleasantly surprised to learn how fans
              interpret the song differently and find their own meaning in it.
